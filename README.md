# Predict-Retail-Sales
<p>The topic "Applying and comparing the effectiveness of KNN, Linear Regression, Decision Tree & Random Forest to the problem of predicting sales" focuses on researching the application of supervised machine learning regression models to predict sales in the retail industry.</p>
<ul>The research was conducted with three basic goals:
  <li> Understand the process, methods and practices of data mining and data preprocessing;</li>
  <li> Find out important attributes that affect sales;</li>
  <li> Compare models and find the most effective model.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the study, the authors used data from Rossmann - Germany's second largest drug store chain with 3,000 stores in Europe to build a retail sales prediction model based on 4 algorithms KNN, Linear Regression, Decison Tree and Random Forest. The authors use the Python language and the Google Colab support tool to conduct data analysis and build models. Research results show that the Random Forest model is the best performing model (R-square reaches 0.971, RMSE reaches 698.3, RMPSE reaches 0.10782), followed by Decision Tree, KNN and finally Linear Regression. Besides, the research also points out the 5 most important features that impact the model's effectiveness: Competition Distance, Store, Promo, Day Of Week, Competition Open Since Month.</p>
